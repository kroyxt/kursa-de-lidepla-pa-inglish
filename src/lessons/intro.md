# Lingwa de planeta

This is a free [wikibook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/wikibook) on the
[Lingwa de planeta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lingwa_de_planeta) (Lidepla
or LdP for short) constructed language or conlang.

This wikibook is an ongoing translation of the [corresponding Russian
book](https://ru.wikibooks.org/wiki/%D0%9B%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B3%D0%B2%D0%B0_%D0%B4%D0%B5_%D0%BF%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B0).
The authors will be glad to receive some contribution, like your opinion in the
talk page, or some improvements of English in the text, or ideas for exercises.

The book consists of ten lessons, each containing some grammar explanations,
translation exercises, a short text with comments and some useful
conversational phrases. You will find some information about one of the
languages on which the Lidepla conlang is based and read a fragment of Antoine
de St. Exupéry’s The Litte Prince in that language (with transcription). There
will also be a wordlist taken from that language.
