# Lingwa de planeta | Neutral language for international communication

What should an international communication language look like?

Perhaps it should be neutral. That is, it should not belong to any special
nation (like English does, for example). Perhaps it should be easy from the
point of view of grammar. That is, it shouldn't contain many different forms to
be learned (like Russian does, for example). Perhaps it should be easy from the
point of view of pronunciation. That is, its sound should be easy for native
speakers of different languages to pronounce. It should be, perhaps,
euphonious. That is, the speech in it should sound beautiful, and the language
itself should be pleasant to speak because of that. Perhaps it should contain
international and other widely spread words - as they are international indeed.
Also it should perhaps be quite natural, without excessive schematization. And
finally, it should perhaps resemble native languages for the speaker of any
native language... just to be an ideal international language indeed.

Lingwa de planeta, or Lidepla for short, is such a language. It meets all the
above-mentioned claims. It was created as a harmonious whole on the basis of
the most widespread modern languages (English, German, French, Spanish and
Portuguese, as well as Chinese, Russian, Hindi and Arabic).

Certainly, today it is rather difficult to find a Lidepla-speaking person in a
foreign country. But the language, and the learning of it, can still be rather
useful. Really, you are going to learn how to express yourself clearly in a
non-native language, and this is one of the principal tasks that a person
learning their first foreign language has to solve. (It is well known that
every new language is easier to learn than the previous one.) Also, you are
going to learn about 500 words that are very similar (both in phonetics and in
meaning) to really frequent words of the most widely spoken modern languages.

So one can even claim that Lingwa de planeta is not a conlang, but rather a
whole planet Creole language.

We wish you success and pleasure in acquiring the language Lingwa de planeta!

Lidepla letters are read the same way in all positions. In Lidepla there are 17
basic consonants and 5 vowels.

### Vowels

| letter | pronunciation   | example                             |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| a      | like a in bar   | ba ([imperative marker]), man (man) |
| e      | like e in pet   | de (of), pet (five)                 |
| i      | like e in we    | li (they), pi (to drink)            |
| o      | like o in more  | to (that), non (no)                 |
| u      | like ou in soup | bu (not), sun (soon)                |

The letters i and y mean the same sounds, but y is never stressed: pyu (more).
Also y on the end of the word shows that the word is not a verb: krai (to cry)
vs skay (sky).

### Consonants

All the consonants are pronounced in the same way in any position.

| ng     | in the end of a word - like ng in swimming / in the middle of a word - like n + g | feng (wind) |

Letter x means the k + s combination, but can be a little voiced when between
vowels: examen (exam), before a consonant may be pronounced as s: expliki (to
explain).

## Stress

The general rule is as follows: the vowel before the last consonant or y is
stressed.

Examples:

- m**a**ta (mother)
- d**u**mi (to think)
- mat**e**ria (material)
- av**a**n (forward)
- krokod**i**l (crocodile)
- b**a**ya (berry)
- jaop**a**y (signboard)
- su**o**la sole (of shoe)

In combinations ao; au, eu; ai, oi, ei the first vowel is stressed.

Examples:

- h**a**o (good)
- **a**udi (to hear)
- m**a**us (mouse)
- **e**uro (euro)
- kl**a**ida (clothes)
- f**a**il (file)
- br**e**in (brain)
- m**e**il (mail)
- aster**o**ida (asteroid)

There are some exceptions though, as Lidepla tries to keep the pronunciation
close to widespread patterns. You don't need to memorize the rule, just read
the examples attentively. You can also watch the short [special
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3dhsU5UrLw).

1. 4 endings are never stressed:
    - -en (inen inside, iven even)
    - -us (virus virus)
    - -um (forum forum, sirkum around)
    - -er (inter between, kompyuter computer)

2. Endings -ik- and -ul- in (simple) nouns and adjectives are never stressed:
    - gramatika, pedagogika, publika, Afrika, Amerika, politike, logike, unike,
    psikologike, stimula, angula.

3. Ending -im is not stressed in minim (least), minimum, maximum.

4. In some special cases the non-standard stress is indicated by doubled vowel:
    - kwantitaa (quantity)
    - kwalitaa (quality) (and all the abstract nouns with suffix -itaa)
    - namastee (how do you do, hello)
    - adyoo (bye),
    - bifoo (before),
    - malgree (in spite of)

The stress doesn't change when forming the following:

1. the plural form of nouns (-(e)s):
    - kitaba|kitabas
    - book|books
    - man|manes
    - man|men

2. adverbs formed from adjectives:
    - jamile|jamilem
    - beautiful|beautifully

3. nouns formed from verbs:
    - lopi|loping
    - run|running

Compound words retain the stress of the components. Suffixes beginning with a
consonant may have additional stress:

- ginalik (womanlike) (from gina woman),
- kusishil (tending to bite) (from kusi to bite),
- ofnitul (bottle-opener)
- vidibile (visible)
