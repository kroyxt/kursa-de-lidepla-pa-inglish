## Pronouns as objects

Pronouns in Lidepla do not change. If a pronoun is placed after the
verb, it will function as an object (i.e., it will answer the question "who?
what?"):

| Lidepla     | English     |
|-------------|-------------|
| Me lubi yu. | I love you. |

To say "oneself", the word **swa** is used (for all
pronouns). To convey the meaning of "each other" or "one another",
there is the word **mutu**.

| Lidepla                   | English                         |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Li lubi **mutu**.         | They love each other.           |
| Ela bu samaji-te **swa**. | She did not understand herself. |

An inanimate object can be replaced by the pronoun **it**.

| Lidepla         | English                            |
|-----------------|------------------------------------|
| Me vidi **it**. | I see it - referring to an object. |

### Translation Exercise

- They will not hear it.
- She does not know herself.
- You will not hear each other.
- You do not hear yourself.
- We understood each other.

## Main Prepositions

To answer the question "to whom?", the preposition **a** is used.

| Lidepla                | English                                        |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Me ve shwo **a** yu.   | I will speak/tell you.                         |
| Ta dai-te it **a** me. | He/she gave it to me - referring to an object. |

To answer the question "about what? about whom?", the
preposition **om** is needed.

| Lidepla               | English                 |
|-----------------------|-------------------------|
| Me ve dumi **om** yu. | I will think about you. |

Other important prepositions: **fo** (for), **por** (because of), **kun**
(with), **sin** (without)

| Lidepla             | English                             |
|---------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Me bu go sin yu.    | I will not go without you.          |
| Me jivi fo yu.      | I live for you.                     |
| Ta bu kredi por yu. | He does not believe because of you. |

### Translation Exercise

- for me
- about you
- because of us
- for you (plural)
- with you
- without her
- because of you

A preposition can also be followed by a verb:

| Lidepla                    | English                                      |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Me bu yao shwo sin samaji. | I don't want to speak without understanding. |

## Question and Demonstrative Words

Question words:

- **hu** - who
- **kwo** - what
- **wo** - where
- **a wo** - where to
- **fon wo** - where from
- **wen** - when
- **way** - why
- **komo** - how

Question words are placed, as a rule, at the beginning of the
sentence; the word order in the sentence does not change.

| Lidepla          | English          |
|------------------|------------------|
| **Kwo** yu vidi? | What do you see? |

### Translation Exercise

- Who understands?
- Who knew?
- What did you know?
- What will he understand?
- Where did you work?
- Where will we work?
- Where are you going to and from?
- When did he arrive?
- Why don't you understand?
- How do you speak?

You can answer questions with question words using demonstrative words:

- **se** - this
- **to** - that
- **hir** - here
- **dar** - there
- **ahir** - to here
- **adar** - to there
- **dan** - then
- **tak** - so, thus

| Lidepla                   | English                             |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Me bu samaji **se**.      | I don't understand this.            |
| Ta bu yao shwo om **to**. | He doesn't want to talk about that. |
| Me jivi **hir**.          | I live here.                        |
| Nu jivi-te **dar**.       | We lived there.                     |
| Me ve go **adar**.        | I will go there.                    |
| Ta lai-te **ahir**.       | He came here.                       |
| **Dan** me samaji-te.     | Then I understood.                  |
| Me shwo **tak**.          | I speak like this.                  |

## Complex Sentence

Question words can also begin a subordinate clause:

| Lidepla               | English                    |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|
| Me jan way yu bu gun. | I know why you don't work. |

Also to create complex sentences the word (conjunction)
**ke** (that) is used:

| Lidepla                                 | English                                          |
|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Me jan **ke** yu lubi lu.               | I know that you love him.                        |
| Ela bu samaji-te **ke** lu bu lubi ela. | She did not understand that he did not love her. |

It is important not to confuse the words **kwo** and **ke**:

| Lidepla                   | English                         |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Me jan **kwo** yu lubi.   | I know what (exactly) you love. |
| Me jan **ke** yu lubi me. | I know that you love me.        |

Note that in Lidepla there is no sequence of tenses: in
the subordinate clause, the particles indicate the time of the action in
relation to the action in the main clause.

| Lidepla                      | English                       |
|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Me shwo ke me ve go adar.    | I say that I will go there.   |
| Me shwo-te ke me ve go adar. | I said that I would go there. |

### Translation Exercise

- You know where I lived.
- He sees how I wait.
- I don't understand what you want (yao).
- We said that they would travel (safari).
- She doesn't believe that you will come (lai).
- They don't know where I will go (go).
- I don't understand what you sing about (gani).
- You don't know who she dances with (dansi).
- I don't understand how you speak without thinking.

Another way to build a complex sentence: **preposition + particle ke**:

| Lidepla                                               | English                                                                           |
|-------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Me shwo-te **om ke** ta lubi yu.                      | I spoke about the fact that he loves you.                                         |
| Me bu yao go kun yu **sin ke** yu shwo ke yu lubi me. | I don't want to go with you unless you say (without you saying) that you love me. |

## Generalizing Meaning

In English there is the construction "whoever", "whatever", etc., which can
appear after any question word at the beginning of a subordinate clause:
whoever, whatever, however. In Lidepla,
this construction is expressed with a single word: **unkwe**, which can be
placed in the same way after any question word (the
verb is used in its basic form):

| Lidepla                                  | English                                  |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Me ve lai a yu, kwo **unkwe** yu shwo.   | I will come to you, whatever you say.    |
| Me bu jawabi, hu **unkwe** kwesti om yu. | I do not answer, whoever asks about you. |

Sometimes it doesn't matter who does something. For this case there is the pronoun **oni**,
which can be translated as "one", "someone", "they".

| Lidepla                             | English                               |
|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Oni** shwo ke ta bu lubi yu.      | It is said that he does not love you. |
| Me lubi yu, kwo unkwe **oni** shwo. | I love you, whatever they say.        |

### Translation Exercise

- Wherever you live
- Whatever he thinks
- Whoever comes
- However they ask me

## Special Verbs

Special verbs that express an attitude towards the action are usually called
"modal". With their help you can form verbal sequences:

- **mog** – can (broad sense)
- **janmog** – to know how (to have the skill)
- **darfi** – to have permission
- **treba** – to need (broad sense)
- **mus** – must (obligation)
- **gai** – should, it is recommended according to the rules
- **majbur** – to be forced/obliged
- **nidi** – to need
- **yao** – to want
- **pri** – to like, to feel pleasure

Special verbs themselves can take particles that specify the
time. The main verbs after the special ones remain in their
basic form.

| Lidepla                    | English               |
|----------------------------|-----------------------|
| Yu **mus** helpi me.       | You must help me.     |
| Me bu **mog**-te helpi yu. | I could not help you. |

The subject before a special verb can be omitted. In this case, the phrase
acquires an impersonal meaning:

| Lidepla    | English        |
|------------|----------------|
| Treba gun. | One must work. |

### Translation Exercise

- She will want to ask you.
- We like to work.
- I had to ask (pregi).
- You should hope.
- Here one cannot (is not allowed to) dance (dansi).
- One must answer when asked.
- He did not come (lai), because he did not want to see him/her.

## Emphatic Particles hi and ku

To highlight, to emphasize the meaning of the whole sentence (that is,
mainly its predicate) we use, as we already know, the particle **ya**. But
in Lidepla there is also a more targeted action particle: it emphasizes
precisely the word before which it is located. This is the particle
**hi**:

| Lidepla                    | English                                         |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Me **hi** ga bu yao go.    | I personally do not want to go at all.          |
| Me yao go **hi**, bu lopi. | I want to go precisely by walking, not running. |

To emphasize a word in a question, there is the particle **ku**. With
it you can easily ask a (general) question to a specific word
in the sentence (the particle is placed after the word):

| Lidepla              | English                            |
|----------------------|------------------------------------|
| Yu **ku** bu yao go? | Is it you who does not want to go? |

The particle **ku** is useful when you need to ask a general question to a
short phrase:

| Lidepla        | English         |
|----------------|-----------------|
| Yu lai **ku**? | Are you coming? |

### Translation Exercise

- I am talking precisely about you.
- Is it she who loves you?
- I (precisely) know, (and) do not believe.

## Useful Words for Narrations

In a story, for example, about oneself or about one's abilities,
the word **yoshi** ("and also") can be useful:

| Lidepla                                    | English                          |
|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Me janmog gani. **Yoshi** me janmog rasmi. | I can sing. And I can also draw. |

In a dialogue, however, the word **toshi** ("also") can be useful:

| Lidepla                         | English               |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Me janmog gani. - Me **toshi**. | I can sing. - Me too. |

Useful conjunctions:

- **sikom** - since, as
- **obwol** - although
- **yedoh** - however

### Translation Exercise

- I believe them too.
- I don't work. And I don't love you either.
- I need to understand right now.
- I can't understand, although I have to work.
- He may come suddenly. She doesn't want to wait, however, he loves her.
- We don't want to see him again.
- I believe, since I don't want to live without you.
- Then I will answer you (jawabi).

| rasmi   | to draw             | nu bu **rasmi**-te, me ve **rasmi** yu, kwo yu **rasmi**?          |

> The preposition "a" can be omitted, since the verb "helpi" has no other
> direct object.

Read the text. Clarify the meaning of the words you don't understand. Try
to retell this text or create your own.

- Me kwesti ta: "Hu komandi hir?"
- Ta bu jawabi. Me snova kwesti: "Way yu bu jawabi? Ob yu bu mog shwo?"
- Ta shwo: "Me mog. Bat me bu jan kwo shwo. Bikos me bu jan hu komandi. Nu oli
lubi mutu." (From Gianni Rodari)

+ komandi (to command)

## Etiquette: Where are you from? Where do you live?

Before asking a question, it may be appropriate to apologize: **Skusi**.

When meeting someone, you can ask: **Wo yu jivi?** (Where do you live?).
In the answer you will need the preposition **in** (in):

- Me jivi in Sankt-Peterburg. (I live in St. Petersburg.)

You can also ask **Fon wo yu lai?** (Where do you come from?). In
the answer you will need the preposition **fon** (from). The names of the
countries in Lidepla sound as close as possible to how they are pronounced in the
language of those countries:

- **Rusia** - Russia
- **Ingland** - England
- **Frans** - France
- **Doichland** - Germany
- **Espania** - Spain
- **Nipon** - Japan
- **Jungwo** - China

| Lidepla               | English             |
|-----------------------|---------------------|
| Me lai fon **Rusia**. | I come from Russia. |

## Language in Focus: Chinese

Despite all its popularity, English ranks only third in terms of
number of speakers (around 300 million people). Speakers
of Chinese are more than double that (more than 800 million)! The Chinese language is very
ancient: scientists have found inscriptions on the bones of sacrificed
animals dating back to at least the 11th century BC. The peculiarity of the unified
Chinese writing system is that the symbols do not convey sounds, but
meanings of words. On the basis of this system several
dialects were formed, which developed independently within different
states. Over time, the dialects formed in the north became more
widespread. It was they that served as the basis for the formation of the official
language of the Chinese empire, in which all important documents were written,
as well as the language of the common people, which was only used in
oral communication. The lexical composition of the language underwent significant
transformations twice: in the 1st century AD with the arrival of Buddhism, the
language was enriched with a whole layer of concepts, and since the beginning of the
20th century, the language has adopted concepts adapted from Western civilization.

Excerpt from "The Little Prince" in Chinese (the transcription has been written using
the sounds of Lidepla very approximately, without indicating the tones):

    啊！我的小王子 ......
    A! wo de syao wan zi

    就这样，一点一滴地，我逐渐懂得了你那忧郁的小生命。
    ziou je yan, idyen-idi-de, wo ju zien dun de le ni na you yu de syao shen min

    长久以来，你惟一的乐趣只是欣赏落日。
    ch'han ziou I lai, ni wei i de le tsiu ji shi sin shan luo r/shi

    这是我在第四天早晨知道的，当你说出：
    je shi wo zai di si tien zao chen ji dao de dang ni shuo ch'hu

    “我喜欢看夕阳。”
    wo si huan kan si yan

> Reminder: the letter z is pronounced as a soft, vibrant "dz"; the
> letter j is pronounced as a soft, vibrant "y".

Chinese words are composed of syllables, each of which has its
own meaning. The sound of the language is very peculiar, different from the
usual European languages. The fact is that in Chinese not only the sounds
themselves have meaning, but also the tones, that is, how exactly the
syllable is pronounced: whether the voice rises when pronouncing the syllable, or
falls, or remains at the same height.
