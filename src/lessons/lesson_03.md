## Nouns

Nouns are words that answer the question "what?" or "who?".

Nouns can be simple and derived. Examples of simple nouns:

- **jen** - person
- **kinda** - child
- **flor** - flower
- **kitaba** - book
- **dom** - house
- **amiga** - friend
- **taim** - time

It is important to note that the noun itself does not carry the meaning of
quantity. Thus, the word **flor**, for example, depending on the context,
can mean both "flower" (singular) and "flowers" (plural).

To specify singularity, the word **un** (one) can be placed
before the word:

| Lidepla     | English  |
|-------------|----------|
| **un** flor | a flower |

Another way to specify singularity (one piece, one bit): the particle
(countable word) **-ge** (placed after the word):

| Lidepla          | English   |
|------------------|-----------|
| flor-**ge** flor | one piece |

To specify plurality, words denoting quantity are used (for
example, **mucho** - "many"), or the plural form (see [lesson 5]() for
more details).

| Lidepla        | English      |
|----------------|--------------|
| **mucho** flor | many flowers |

The idea of gender (more precisely, sex) by default is implied only in
a series of nouns denoting people:

| Feminine                     | Masculine             |
|------------------------------|-----------------------|
| **gina** (woman)             | **man** (man)         |
| **gela** (girl)              | **boy** (boy)         |
| **mata** (mother)            | **patra** (father)    |
| **docha** (daughter)         | **son** (son)         |
| **sista** (sister)           | **brata** (brother)   |
| **tia** (aunt)               | **onkla** (uncle)     |
| **oma** (grandmother)        | **opa** (grandfather) |
| **kindocha** (granddaughter) | **kinson** (grandson) |

If it is necessary to specify gender in other cases, use:

- the prefixes **gin-** | **man-**

| Lidepla       | English       |
|---------------|---------------|
| **gin**-leker | female doctor |
| **man**-leker | male doctor   |
| **gin**-kota  | female cat    |
| **man**-kota  | male cat      |

- the suffix **-o**

| Lidepla   | English     |
|-----------|-------------|
| amig**o** | male friend |

- the replacement of the ending a with **-ina**

| Lidepla     | English       |
|-------------|---------------|
| amig**ina** | female friend |

The noun in Lidepla has no case forms. However, 2
different case meanings of the noun are distinguished from the point of view of its
function in the sentence (the same 2 case meanings are also relevant
for personal pronouns):

- nominative case meaning (position before the verb)

| Lidepla      | English                |
|--------------|------------------------|
| me jan       | I know                 |
| amiga samaji | the friend understands |

- oblique case meaning (position after the verb or after a
preposition)

| Lidepla          | English                  |
|------------------|--------------------------|
| yu samaji        | you understand me        |
| me shwo om amiga | I speak about the friend |

If necessary, to indicate the case meaning of the word when changing
the word order (for example, in order to especially highlight the
meaning of the word), special particles **da** can be used
for the nominative case meaning and **den** for the oblique case meaning:

| Lidepla                                                     | English                                            |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Me vidi amiga.                                              | I see the friend.                                  |
| **Den** amiga me vidi.                                      | The friend I see.                                  |
| Om hu yu shwo? - **Den** amiga om.                          | Who are you talking about? - About the friend.     |
| Ob lu samaji ela? - Non, samaji **da** ela (hi) **den** lu. | Does he understand her? - No, she understands him. |

Such particles allow a practically free word order in the
sentence. However, it should be noted that these particles should not be overused.

## Verbal Nouns

Nouns can be formed from verbs.

A general noun, related to the action, denoting a process /
result, is formed by:

- replacing the final "i" with "a" (if the verb ends in consonant + i):
    - **lubi** - to love
    - **luba** - love

- adding "a" (if the verb ends in consonant + i, but is monosyllabic):
    - **pri** - to like
    - **pria** - affection, liking

- adding "sa" (if the verb does not end in i):
    - **gun** - to work
    - **gunsa** - work

### Translation Exercise

- hope
- knowledge
- help
- request
- joy
- question
- answer
- arrival
- song
- journey

It is important to note that in all the above cases the noun is
related to the verb, but carries some additional meaning. However,
a pure verbal noun, which denotes precisely the action as such, can also be formed
with the help of the suffix -**ing**:

- swimi (to swim) swim**ing** (swimming)
- janmi (to be born, to give birth) janm**ing** (process of birth, childbirth) (janma -
birth)

## Adjectives

Adjectives answer the question "which?"

Examples of adjectives:

- **hao** - good
- **buhao** - not good, bad
- **gran** - big
- **syao** - small
- **jamile** - beautiful

> Reminder: in the combination ao, the a is stressed; the letter j is read
> as a soft, vibrant "y".

Together with adjectives, to clarify the meaning, the following words are used:

- **muy** - very
- **idyen** - a little
- **aika** - quite, very
- **basta** - enough
- **tro** - too much
- **ga** - completely
- **ga syao** - completely small
- **basta gran** - sufficiently large
- **muy jamile** - very beautiful
- **aika hao** - quite good

Adjectives can be formed from verbs. An adjective with the
meaning of "prone to doing something" is formed from a verb by adding
the suffix **-shil** (the position of the stress does not change):

- samaji**shil** - understanding
- dumi**shil** - thoughtful
- gun**shil** - hardworking

Adjectives with the meaning of "that can be..." are formed with the suffix
**-bile** (the word receives an additional stress on the suffix):

- vidi**bile** - visible
- audi**bile** - audible
- samaji**bile** - understandable

### Translation Exercise

- loving
- traveling
- often asking
- trustworthy
- hopeful
- prone to hoping

## Verb bi / es / bin

In Lidepla, verbs do not change their form, except for the only verb "to be": the
exceptional verb **bi** has the form **es** in the present tense and **bin** in the past tense.
Before the copulative verb bi/es/bin there is usually a noun, and after
it, an adjective.

The verb bi/es/bin is never omitted.

| Lidepla                     | English                        |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Kinda **es** ga syao.       | The child is very small.       |
| Ob flor **bin** muy jamile? | Was the flower very beautiful? |
| Ob kitaba **es** basta hao? | Is the book good enough?       |

In special questions with the verb **bi (es, bin)** it is possible and, as a rule,
inversion occurs, that is, the verb is placed immediately
after the question word:

| Lidepla       | English        |
|---------------|----------------|
| Wo **es** yu? | Where are you? |

In a complex sentence with a question word, as a rule, there is no
inversion:

| Lidepla          | English               |
|------------------|-----------------------|
| Me jan wo yu es. | I know where you are. |

### Translation Exercise

- The book is quite big.
- The child is too small.
- Where is the flower?
- The flower was very beautiful.
- How will the house be?
- The house will be very good.

If the subject is expressed by the word **se** ("this") or the pronouns
**ta** or **it**, it can be omitted, both in the question and in the answer (if
the meaning is understood from the context):

| Lidepla                        | English           |
|--------------------------------|-------------------|
| Kwo es **se**? Kwo es?         | What is this?     |
| **Se** es kinda. Es kinda.     | It is a child.    |
| Kwel es **ta**? Kwel es?       | What is he like?  |
| **Ta** es ga syao. Es ga syao. | He is very small. |

## Adjective as an attribute

Of course, nouns, like personal pronouns, can
play the role of subject or object of a verb.

| Lidepla          | English             |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Ob kinda jan-te? | Did the child know? |
| Me vidi un flor. | I see a flower.     |

In such a function, nouns can be accompanied by adjectives.

The attribute, as a rule, is located before the word it modifies.

| Lidepla                     | English                                |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Syao kinda bu ve samaji yu. | A small child will not understand you. |
| Me pri jamile flor.         | I like beautiful flowers (in general). |

Demonstrative words:

- **sey** - this
- **toy** - that
- **tal** - such

| Lidepla                 | English                     |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------|
| **Sey** flor es jamile. | This flower is beautiful.   |
| **Toy** kitaba es syao. | That book is small.         |
| Me bu pri **tal** jen.  | I don't like such a person. |

### Translation Exercise

- This child is small, but quite understanding.
- That person was very good.
- I don't like this house: it's too small.
- You shouldn't talk to that person: he won't be a good friend for you.
- That house is big enough for us to live in.
- This child is too fond of asking questions.

## Verbs of existence ye, yok, hev

Sometimes it is necessary to say "there is" not in the sense of quality, but in the
sense of presence or absence of something. In this case, instead of the verb
**bi**, the words **ye** (there is, exists) and **yok** (there is not, is
absent) are used:

| Lidepla          | English               |
|------------------|-----------------------|
| Ob ye kitaba?    | Is there a book?      |
| Ya, kitaba ye.   | Yes, there is a book. |
| Non, kitaba yok. | No, there is no book. |

To report something belonging to someone, the verb **hev** - to have - is used.

| Lidepla                | English                    |
|------------------------|----------------------------|
| Me hev un jamile flor. | I have a beautiful flower. |

### Translation Exercise

- There is a small house there.
- There are no flowers here.
- We will have a child.
- He had such a book.

## Adjectives and possessive pronouns

To ask the question "whose?" and answer it, the determining particle
**ney** is used:

| Lidepla                  | English                 |
|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| Hu-**ney** kitaba es?    | Whose book is this?     |
| Es kinda-**ney** kitaba. | It is the child's book. |

Compound adjectives are possible:

| Lidepla              | English            |
|----------------------|--------------------|
| sey-kinda-ney kitaba | this child's book. |

The same meaning can be expressed with the preposition **de**:

| Lidepla                     | English                       |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Es kitaba **de** sey kinda. | It is the book of this child. |

With the same particle **-ney**, possessive pronouns can also be formed, in principle:
**me-ney**, **yu-ney**, **ta-ney**, etc. But possessive pronouns are very often used in speech, so there are also short forms for them:
**may** (my), **yur** (your, yours), **nuy** (our), **ley** (their), **suy** (his/her), **luy** (his),
**elay** (her).

|            | Singular       | Plural |
|------------|----------------|--------|
| 1st person | may            | nuy    |
| 2nd person | yur            |        |
| 3rd person | suy, luy, elay | ley    |

From the reflexive pronoun swa, the possessive pronoun **swa-ney**
(own) can be formed.

### Translation Exercise

- my child
- my child's book
- your book
- my own house
- our child's friend
- their time
- his flower

## Particles gro- and -ki

In the Lidepla language, the following are widely used:

- the augmentative prefix particle **gro-**
- the diminutive-affective suffix particle **-ki**

| Lidepla      | English                              |
|--------------|--------------------------------------|
| **gro**-pri  | to like very much, to love very much |
| **gro**-jen  | great person (in different senses)   |
| **gro**-hao  | excellent                            |
| kinda-**ki** | little child                         |
| somni-**ki** | to doze, "to sleep"                  |

To form the diminutive-affective of a noun or a name, the final vowel can be
replaced by "**i**"; a long name can be shortened to one
syllable (this method is not always applicable):

- doga (dog) - dog**i** (little dog (affective form))
- Dimitri - Dim**i**
- Konstantin - Konst**i**

Also in the language there are the word-forming suffixes **-kin** and
**-gron**, which serve to form nouns with a new quality:

- kitaba (book) - kitaba**gron** (huge volume, folio)
- dom (house) - dom**kin** (e.g., greenhouse)

- beautiful
- urgently need

## Etiquette: greetings, "how are you?"

When greeting at different times of the day, the following expressions can be used:

| Lidepla     | English                                     |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Hao sabah!  | Good morning!                               |
| Hao dey!    | Good day!                                   |
| Hao aksham! | Good evening!                               |
| Hao nocha!  | Good night! (at night, when saying goodbye) |

> The words sabah, dey, aksham, nocha themselves mean morning, day,
> evening and night respectively.

To ask "How are you?" the verb sta ("to be in a certain state") will be needed:

| Lidepla         | English                         |
|-----------------|---------------------------------|
| Komo yu sta?    | How are you? How are you doing? |

| Me bu sta hao.  | Not very well.                  |
| Me sta buhao.   | I am not well. Things are bad.  |

## Spanish and Portuguese languages

By number of speakers, Spanish ranks second after Chinese
(around 400 million people). Spanish belongs to the group of
Romance languages, which means that it originated from Vulgar Latin, that is,
the language spoken among common Romans, and that it began to spread throughout the
territory of present-day Spain at the end of the 3rd century BC, after
Spain became part of the Roman domains. At that time, in the
Iberian (Pyrenean) peninsula lived a large number of different tribes,
the most numerous being the Iberians and the Celts. In the Mediterranean lands
there were Greek colonies. And, in addition, already in the 5th century
settlements of Germanic tribes appeared on the peninsula. As a consequence, a
huge number of words in modern Spanish have a direct connection
with Celtic, Greek, Phoenician and Visigothic analogies. From the 8th century to
the 15th century, Arab rule took place in the Iberian Peninsula. The
interaction between Arab and Christian culture was not simple or unambiguous. But,
be that as it may, the influence of Arabic on Spanish was enormous and undeniable.
In medieval times, Spain was in a fragmented state, and different dialects were spoken in different lands.
But among all the lands, Castile gradually became the most powerful and influential, and
it was Castilian that became the basis of modern Spanish. However,
the differences in pronunciation and lexicon in the different provinces
of Spain are clearly noticeable to this day.

Excerpt from "The Little Prince" (the accent mark is placed before the stressed
syllable, the combinations ue, ua are pronounced as one, the accent on the
second sound:)

    ¡Ah, principito!
    aa prinsi'pito

    Así, poco a poco, comprendí tu pequeña vida melancólica.
    a'si 'poko a 'poko kompren'di tu pe'kenya 'vida melan'kolika

    Durante mucho tiempo tu única distracción fue la suavidad de las puestas de sol.
    du'rante mucho 'tyempo tu 'unika dis'trakf/sion fue la suavi'dad de las pu'estas de sol

    Me enteré de este nuevo detalle, en la mañana del cuarto día, cuando me dijiste:
    me ente're de 'este 'nuevo de'taye en la ma'nyana del ku'arto 'dia 'kuando me di'histe

    Me encantan las puestas de sol.
    me en'kantan las 'puestas de sol

Portuguese is a language closely related to Spanish, and also
one of the most spoken languages on earth.

Excerpt from "The Little Prince" in Portuguese:

    Ah, Principezinho!
    aa prinsipezinyu

    Assim, aos poucos, fui ficando a conhecer a tua melancólica vidinha!
    assim aus poukus fui fikandu a konyeser a tua melankolika vijinya

    Durante muito tempo, a tua única distracção foi a beleza dos crepúsculos.
    duranchi muintu tempu, a tua unika jistrasaun foi a beleza dus krepuskulus

    Fiquei a sabê-lo na manhã do quarto dia, quando me disseste:
    fikei a sabelu na manyan du kwartu dia, kwandu mi jiseschi

    Gosto muito dos pores do Sol.
    gostu muintu dous poris ji sou.
