In total 47 vocabulary units (+167 from lessons 1-3 = a total of

## Expressing commands, requests, wishes

The basic form, used without a subject, expresses the imperative:

- Jawabi! (Answer!)

To express a request, **plis** (please) or **bi karim**
(be so kind) is usually added.

| Lidepla             | English          |
|---------------------|------------------|
| Helpi (a) me, plis. | Help me, please. |

> if the verb obviously has only an indirect object, the preposition
> can be omitted: helpi a me = helpi me

To explicitly express the imperative, the particle **ba** can be added:

| Lidepla                        | English                       |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Shwo **ba**!                   | Speak!                        |
| Plis, bu ofni **ba** sey dwar. | Please, don't open this door. |

To express the imperative in negative form, the particle
**bye** is also used (in this case the particle ba is not necessary):

| Lidepla             | English               |
|---------------------|-----------------------|
| **Bye** klosi dwar! | Don't close the door! |

The meaning "let's (do something)" can also be expressed with the particle
**ba**:

| Lidepla       | English         |
|---------------|-----------------|
| Nu **go** ba! | Let's go!       |
| Ta **go** ba! | Let him/her go! |

A wish can also be expressed with the following particles (they are placed at
the beginning of the sentence):

- **Hay** - Volitive, I wish
- **Magari** - hopefully
- **Nomagari** - hopefully not

| Lidepla                       | English                         |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Hay** ta lai!               | May he/she come!                |
| **Magari** ela shwo om me!    | I wish she would talk about me! |
| **Nomagari** li kwesti om se! | I hope they don't ask this!     |

After these particles, not only the basic form of the verb can be used.

| Lidepla                        | English                                     |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Magari** ta he kwesti om to! | I wish he/she had already asked about that! |

> wish that the action has already occurred

### Translation Exercise

- Please don't run: I can't understand what you're telling me.
- Please give me my flower. It's there.
- Please read this book to me: I want to hear you read.
- I wish he/she understood me!
- I wish I hadn't believed them!
- Wait for me here, please.
- Let him/her talk to me about it.

## Condition and conditionality

When responding to a request, sometimes the word "would" is needed: **wud**.

| Lidepla                                        | English                                      |
|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Me **wud** helpi yu, bat me bu mog: me mus go. | I would help you, but I can't: I have to go. |

And the word "would" is closely related to the word

- **si** - if...
- **dan** - then

| Lidepla                                       | English                          |
|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Me wud mog helpi yu **si** yu wud pregi.      | I could help you if you asked.   |
| **Si** yu wud pregi **dan** me wud mog helpi. | If you asked, then I could help. |

The word (conjunction) "if" can, of course, be used without "would":

| Lidepla                         | English                      |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Si yu pregi, (dan) me ve helpi. | If you ask, I will help you. |

### Translation Exercise

- If you don't believe me, I won't come.
- If you want to play and not work, don't come.
- Could you sleep if we sang and danced here?
- I would answer you, but I don't understand what you're asking about.

## Clarification of the time of the action

When responding to a request, explaining something in the answer, sometimes it is
necessary to specifically indicate that an action is happening at this
moment, soon, or, on the contrary, that it has just finished.

For this, in Lidepla there are special clarifying particles:

- **zai** - "right now"
- **sal** - "very soon", "I'm going to"
- **he** - "already finished"
- **yus he** - "just finished"

| Lidepla                               | English                                                      |
|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Me bu mog jawabi nau: me **zai** chi. | I can't answer now: I'm eating.                              |
| Me bu mog lai: nu **sal** chi deyfan. | I can't come: we are about to have dinner ("to eat dinner"). |


The particles **wud** and **he** can go together before the verb if it is about
a supposition about the past:

| Lidepla                                        | English                                  |
|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Si yu **wud he** kwesti, me **wud he** jawabi. | If you had asked, I would have answered. |
| Bat yu bu **he** kwesti e me bu **he** jawabi. | But you didn't ask, and I didn't answer. |


Pay attention that some verbs can participate in the construction of
verbal sequences:

| Lidepla    | English        |
|------------|----------------|
| go somni   | go to sleep    |
| begin shwo | begin to speak |
| stopi gani | stop singing   |

### Translation Exercise

- I came, I'm eating and I'm going to sleep.
- He just finished dancing.
- He's about to start playing now.
- I would have told you, but you didn't come.

It can also happen that you need to say that the action, in principle, took
place, at some point, no matter when.

Or that it never happened. For this there is the particle **gwo**:

| Lidepla                                     | English                                        |
|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Me gwo visiti ela. Me bu yao go adar snova. | I visited her. I don't want to go there again. |
| Me bu gwo shwo kun ela.                     | I didn't talk to her (not once in my life).    |


### Translation Exercise

- He says he just arrived and therefore cannot read the letter (leta) right
now.
- He didn't understand that she had (never) seen him, and wouldn't come if I didn't talk
to her.
- I had to work today, so I just got home, I'm eating and
talking to the kids about why there are no crocodiles (krokodil) in America ("ik" unstressed, the accent
falls on the e).
- I will not open the door (dwar) of my house, whoever comes and whatever they say.
I will not go because she does not want to open the door for me.

## Aspect prefixes

Often, especially when telling a story, when it matters how actions
relate to each other, it is important to show that the action began,
or that it was abrupt, brief, unique.

For this there are the following verbal prefixes:

- **en**- - beginning of the action
- **ek**- - sudden, one-time

| Lidepla                      | English                                                                        |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Nu promeni e ta **en**-gani. | We are (were) walking, and he starts to sing (started to sing, began to sing). |
| Nu audi ke koywan ek-krai.   | We hear (heard) that someone suddenly cried out.                               |

With the help of these prefixes, verbs corresponding to Russian perfective
verbs can also be formed:

- **jan** - to know
- **en**-jan - to find out
- **krai** - to shout
- **ek**-krai - to shout suddenly

### Translation Exercise

- to want
- to get up
- to remember
- to move
- to fall asleep

## Transitivity / intransitivity particles

Many verbs in Lidepla can be used with or without an object:

| Lidepla       | English          |
|---------------|------------------|
| Dwar ofni.    | The door opens.  |
| Me ofni dwar. | I open the door. |


However, in some cases it is necessary to specifically emphasize the absence
of an object (intransitivity of the verb).

This can be done with the particle **fa**-:

| Lidepla                                  | English                                                |
|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Ela **fa**-astoni.                       | She is surprised (was surprised).                      |
| Oni mog audi musika. Musika **fa**-audi. | One can hear music. Music is heard, the sound arrives. |

With the particle **mah**- you can emphasize transitivity or form a transitive
verb:

- **astoni** - to surprise (oneself)
- **mah**-astoni - to surprise
- **remembi** - to remember
- **mah**-remembi - to remember, to bring to mind
- **chi** - to eat
- **mah**-chi - to feed

### Translation Exercise

- to give to drink
- to plant
- to be visible

The same particles are also used with adjectives to indicate a change in
quality:

- **mah**- (to make or turn something)
- **fa**- (to become or turn into something)

> they are written before the adjective with a hyphen

- **syao** - small
- **mah**-syao - to decrease
- **gran** - big
- **fa**-gran - to increase, to grow

It should be noted that these verbs mainly denote a change in quality.
To indicate the establishment of a new quality, there is also the verb
**bikam** (to become):

| Lidepla                       | English                                |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Kinda sal **bikam** aika gao. | The child will soon become quite tall. |

To form verbs (from adjectives or other verbs) suffixes can also be used:

- -**(i)fi** - synonym of fa
- -**(i)si** - synonym of mah

+ klare - clear
+ klar**ifi** - to become clear
+ klar**isi** - to clarify

The particle **fa**- can also be used with nouns that designate, for
example, the time of day:

- **dey** - day
- **fa**-dey - to dawn, to become day

## Expression of supposition

A supposition can be expressed with the words:

- **shayad** - probably
- **mogbi** - perhaps
- **musbi** - must be

> after these words, the basic form of the verb is usually used if the
> supposition refers to the future:

| Lidepla                     | English                           |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Shayad** ta bu lai sedey. | He/she probably won't come today. |
| **Mogbi** li he lai?        | Perhaps they have already come?   |

In such sentences, the words **yo** (already) and **haishi**
(still, yet) can be useful:

| Lidepla                                     | English                                |
|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Shayad yur kinda **haishi** bu janmog shwo. | Probably your child still can't speak. |
| Mogbi yur kinda janmog gani **yo**?         | Perhaps your child can already sing?   |

## Language in focus: The Arabic language

The number of native Arabic speakers is estimated at around 250 million
people. However, classical Arabic, as the language of the Quran, is used in a
limited way by followers of Islam worldwide, which already totals
more than one and a half billion people.

The appearance of the Quran, written in Arabic, in the 7th century, became a
decisive moment in the history of the Arabic language. From that moment, Arabic
script was fully formalized, and the standardization of the
language (which existed mainly as a set of related dialects)
and the development of its literary form began.

Linguists point out that the first monuments of the Arabic language
testify to a significant amount of borrowings from neighboring Semitic and
Aramaic languages, from Persian, Greek, Latin, and later also from Turkish.

The next crucial period in the development of the Arabic language was the turn of
the 18th-19th centuries, when economic contacts between the
Arab East and the West intensified. Today, international scientific and technical
terms and expressions characteristic of the media
actively penetrate the Arabic language, despite the activity of the
academies of the Arabic language, which do everything possible to preserve it in its
most unaltered form.

Excerpt from The Little Prince in Arabic (the transcription only approximately reflects the
pronunciation; in Arabic it is written from right to left):

    ah, ayyuhaa alamiir assaghiir, maa alwakt kadartu alaa an afham hayaataka alkaiiba, waktan tawiilan mad/saa wa lam tamlik — lita'aasii nafsik — illaa jamaal mash'hid g/huruubi ashams.

    amaltu bihaad/saa fii ssabaahi alyawm arraabi.

    amaltu bihaad/saa fii alyawmi arraabi indamaa kult :

    "anaa uhibbu mashaahid ghuruubi ashams kat/siran, ta'aala, dina nuraakib hidaahaa.
