- **char** - four
- **pet** - five
- **sit** - six

To count from 11 to 19, the word denoting the units is placed before
the word **shi** (written with a hyphen):

- **shi**-nin - nineteen)

Analogously:

### Translation Exercise (Lidepla)

- 81
- 395
- 403
- 612
- 5,736
- 88,902
- 3,630,785

If a noun follows a numeral, its form does not change:

| Lidepla  | English      |
|----------|--------------|
| dwa jen  | two people   |
| pet flor | five flowers |

## Inexact Quantity

The form of the noun also does not change after words denoting
quantity:

- **mucho** - much, many
- **shao** - little, few
- **pluri** - several
- **kelke** - some
- **idyen** - a little

nor after the interrogative word **kwanto** (how much/many), nor after the
demonstrative word **tanto** (so much/many):

| Lidepla                                       | English                                          |
|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Kwanto kinda yu hev?                          | How many children do you have?                   |
| May dwa kinda hev mucho kitaba.               | My two children have many books.                 |
| Me hev tanto mani ke me mog kupi un elefanta. | I have so much money that I can buy an elephant. |

However, there is also a special plural form of the noun. To
form it, **s** is added to the noun (if the word ends in a vowel) or
**es** (if the word ends in a consonant):

- kinda - child
- kinda**s** - children
- flor - flower
- flor**es** - flowers

> Note: when forming the plural, the stress placement does not change.

The plural form is used when, for some reason, it is necessary to indicate
plurality in the absence of words indicating quantity:

| Lidepla                  | English                         |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------|
| May kindas bu pri lekti. | My children don't like to read. |

pencil and thanked her (danki).

## Time on the clock

Numerals are important when talking about time. To indicate the exact time,
the word **klok** is used:

| Lidepla                   | English                            |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **klok** pet              | five o'clock                       |

| **klok** pet e haf        | five thirty = half past five       |
| **klok** ot e charfen     | eight fifteen = quarter past eight |
| **klok** tri sin shi      | ten to three = two fifty           |

To ask "What time is it?", the interrogative word **kwel** (which,
what) is used:

| Lidepla                                          | English                                                     |

| Es bli klok shi. | It's around ten o'clock. |

To indicate that something happens at a specific time, the general meaning
preposition **pa** is used:

| Lidepla                  | English                     |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Me (ve) lai pa klok sit. | I will come at six o'clock. |

> here the future tense particle can be omitted.

To the indication of hours, the combinations **pa aksham**
(in the evening) and **pa sabah** (in the morning) can be added:

| Lidepla                                 | English                              |

## Days of the week, months, dates, seasons

The days of the week (wik â€“ week) are formed from numerals by adding
the particle **di** (written together). Alternative names are based on
the names of the planets (the stress always falls on the first syllable):

- un**di** = luna**di** (Monday)
- dwa**di** = marsa**di** (Tuesday)
- tri**di** = merku**di** (Wednesday)
- char**di** = jipi**di** (Thursday)
- pet**di** = venu**di** (Friday)
- sit**di** = satu**di** (Saturday)
- sem**di** = surya**di** (Sunday)

| Lidepla                   | English                        |

| Kwel dey de wik es sedey? | What day of the week is today? |
| Sedey es chardi.          | Today is Thursday.             |

Similarly, using the word **mes** (month), the names
of the months are formed (written with a hyphen). Alternative names are based on
common European names:

- januar = **mes**-un (January)
- februar = **mes**-dwa (February)
- marto = **mes**-tri (March)
- april = **mes**-char (April)
- mey = **mes**-pet (May)
- yuni = **mes**-sit (June)
- yuli = **mes**-sem (July)
- augusto = **mes**-ot (August)
- septemba = **mes**-nin (September)
- oktoba = **mes**-shi (October)
- novemba = **mes**-shi-un (November)
- desemba = **mes**-shi-dwa (December)

| Lidepla                                              | English                                  |

- **hima** - winter
- **vesna** - spring)

With all words denoting days of the week, months, seasons of the
year, and times of day, the general meaning preposition

## Language in focus: Hindi

Hindi ranks fifth in terms of the number of native speakers;
however, in terms of the total number of speakers, it is only surpassed by
Chinese.

The word "Hindi" itself can be understood in different ways: in a
strict sense, it designates the standard literary language; in a broad sense,
it refers to a whole group of closely related dialects.

The history of Hindi dates back centuries, to Central Asia, where a language
was spoken that became the progenitor of many Indo-European languages. The greatest
influences on Hindi come from Sanskrit (an
ancient literary language of India, which served as a language of intercultural
communication) and English (in the mid-19th century, India became a British
colony).

Excerpt from The Little Prince in Hindi (the transcription represents the
pronunciation very approximately; the duplication of a vowel indicates its
length):

    Oh! Nanhen raajkumaar!

    Mainne teraa jeevan, uskee udaasee dheere-dheere samajh lee thee!

    Bahut dinon tak mere paas man bahlaane kaa ek maatr saadhan thaa suuryaast kaa saundarya.

    Iskaa pataa mujhe tujhse mulaakaat ke chauthe din chalaa jab tuune mujhse kahaa:

    "Mujhe suuryaast bahut ach'haa lagtaa hai, aao chalen dekhen!"
