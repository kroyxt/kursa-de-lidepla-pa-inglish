## Adverbs

Adverbs are words that characterize the action. In a sentence, adverbs
refer to verbs (while adjectives describe nouns). Adverbs are often formed
from adjectives (which end in e) by adding **m**:

- lente - slow
- lente**m** - slowly
- jamile - beautiful
- jamile**m** - beautifully

> When forming an adverb from an adjective, the stress position does not
> change.

Adjectives ending in **o** and **y** have the same form as adverbs:

- **hao** - good, well
- **kway** - fast, quickly

From a noun, you can form both adjectives with the particle **-ney**, and
adverbs with the particle **-nem**:

- amiga - friend
- amiga-**ney** - belonging to a friend, friendly
- amiga-**nem** - in a friendly way

In the same way, from (cardinal) numerals, you can form ordinal numerals and
the corresponding adverbs:

- un-**ney** - first
- un-**nem** - firstly
- dwa-**ney** - second
- dwa-**nem** - secondly

Interrogative word: **komo** (how), demonstrative: **tak** (so).

The preposition **bay** introduces the means, the instrument:

| Lidepla                                       | English                               |
|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Komo** yu safari? - Me safari **bay** auto. | How do you travel? - I travel by car. |
| Me bu yao jivi **tak**.                       | I don't want to live like this.       |

With the copulative verbs **bi / es / bin, sta, bikam**, adjectives are

|--------------------|----------------------|
| Ta **es** alegre.  | He is cheerful.      |
| **Es** alegre hir. | It is cheerful here. |

Adverbs of frequency:

- **sempre** - always
- **oftem** - often
- **rarem** - rarely
- **pinchanem** - usually
- **neva** - never

| Lidepla                                 | English                           |

| Ta bu danki **neva**.                   | He never says thank you.          |

> double negation does not change the meaning of the sentence

Miscellaneous adverbs:

- **sertem** - certainly
- **semblem** - apparently, it seems
- **gro** - very, strongly
- **for** - further
- **wek** - away
- **sun** - soon

| Lidepla                            | English                                       |
|------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Sertem** me lai.                 | Of course I will come.                        |

## Comparisons

For comparisons with adjectives and adverbs, the following words are used:

- **pyu** - more
- **meno** - less
- **zuy** - the most
- **minim** - the least
- **kem** - than

> In the word minim the stress is on the first syllable, it is an exception

| Lidepla                             | English                                          |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Yu es **pyu** jamile kem ela.       | You are more beautiful than her.                 |
| Auto muvi **pyu** lentem kem avion. | The car moves more slowly than the plane.        |
| Yu es **zuy** jamile pa munda.      | You are the most beautiful in the world.         |
| Me es **zuy** gao fon may amigas.   | I am the tallest of my friends.                  |
| May avion flai **zuy** kway.        | My plane flies the fastest of all (the fastest). |

The words **pyu, meno, zuy** and **minim** can be used alone with the
meanings, respectively, "more", "less", "the most", "the least":

| Lidepla               | English                        |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------|
| Me lubi mata zuy.     | What I love most is my mother. |
| Me bu samaji **pyu**. | I don't understand anymore.    |

- **zuy mucho = maiste** - most

| Lidepla                                 | English                                         |
|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Maiste** kinda in may klas pri lekti. | Most of the children in my class enjoy reading. |

To indicate comparability, equality, the words **sam** (as) and **kom** (as)
are used:

| Lidepla                       | English                                     |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Yu es **sam** gao **kom** me. | You are as tall as me. (Of my same height). |

The construction "the... the..." - **kem .. tem**:

| Lidepla                            | English                 |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Kem** pyu kway, **tem** pyu hao. | The faster, the better. |

### Translation exercise

- My sister (sista) is taller than my brother (brata).
- This house is the smallest in our city (urba).
- My father (patra) is the best.
- Most people here want to help this child.
- The taller the house, the more people live in it.

## Adjectives and verbs as nouns

When comparing, it is sometimes necessary to repeat the same noun. To avoid
this, noun substitutes are used: the particles **la** and **las**:

| Lidepla                                 | English                                      |
|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Sey flor es pyu jamile kem toy-**la**.  | This flower is more beautiful than that one. |
| Sey kindas es pyu syao kem toy-**las**. | These children are smaller than those.       |

Sometimes forms like **otres** ("others") are used as nouns (this is a
form derived from an adjective according to the law of plural formation of
nouns). But such forms are rather abbreviations of the grammatically correct
**otre-las**.

If it is a person, the word **wan** can be used:

| Lidepla                                 | English                                                       |
|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Tri jen lai. Un-ney **wan** begin shwo. | Three people come (have come). The first one begins to speak. |

Also sometimes it is necessary to talk about a concept, about something
abstract. In this situation the particle **lo** is used:

| Lidepla                    | English                           |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Lo** zuy jamile es luba. | The most beautiful thing is love. |

Instead of a noun in such a sentence, a verb can be used. To show that the
verb is used practically with the meaning of a noun, the particle **tu** is
placed before it:

| Lidepla                               | English                                     |
|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Lo zuy muhim es **tu** remembi om to. | The most important thing is to remember it. |

A verb with the particle **tu** can also be used as a subject with the verb
**bi / es / bin**:

| Lidepla                               | English                      |
|---------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| **Tu** fogeti om to bu **es** fasile. | Forgetting this is not easy. |

### Translation exercise

- I would like to live in the city (urba) and study (studi) there at the
university (universitet).
- I think that at the university they teach (talimi) better than at school
(skola), and that in the city it is more interesting (interes-ney) to study.
- I live in the village (vilaja). To go to the city you have to travel (go bay)
for a long time, first by bus (bus) and then by train (tren).
- I don't like to travel (raki), I like to walk (pedi) more, although traveling
is faster.
- Walking is the slowest and the most interesting.
- The main thing is not to forget to try to see the beautiful.

## Agent and object nouns of action

Nouns that denote the agent or the instrument that performs a certain action
are formed with the suffix **er** (the specific meaning is determined by the
context):

> The suffix er is always unstressed

- talimi - to teach, to give classes
- talim**er** - teacher
- ofni - to open
- ofn**er** - opener

To specify the meaning of the instrument, the suffix **tul** can be used:

- vinti - to screw
- vinti**tul** - screwdriver

Many names of professions are formed with the suffix **er** (although not
always from verbs):

- **leker** - from leki (doctor)
- **talimer** - from talimi (teacher)
- **suter** - from suti (tailor)
- **kuker** - from kuki (cook)
- **shofer** - driver

However, it must be recognized that the names of some very widespread
professions are formed with the suffix -**ista**, as are the names of the
adherents of one or another doctrine (-**ismo**) (in both cases, these words
are formed from nouns):

- **jurnalista** - journalist
- **ateista** - atheist

In some (rare) cases a double formation is possible, for example the
profession of programmer:

- program**er** (from the verb programi)
- program**ista** (from the noun programa)

We have talked about who performs the action. Now let's talk about what the
action is performed on.

The most general way to form a noun that designates the object of an action,
or something related to the action, is with the suffix -**ka** (it can be
considered an abbreviation of the word **kosa** - thing; with this suffix
nouns can be formed not only from verbs).

- plei - to play
- plei**ka** - toy
- trani - to drag
- trani**ka** - tail, trace, what is dragged
- jivi - to live
- jivi**ka** - living being, creature

To specify the direct object of the action, the suffix -**wat** can be used:

- pi - to drink
- pi**wat** - drink
- sendi - to send
- sendi**wat** - package, shipment

To denote the concrete result of an action, there is the suffix -**tura**:

- skribi - to write
- skribi**tura** - writing, inscription
- shwo - to speak
- shwo**tura** - saying, maxim

### Translation exercise

- seller
- dish / food / delicacy
- reading device / reader
- mixture (mixi)

## Nouns related to quality

To form a noun from an adjective, the suffix -**taa** is mainly used (the
final 'e' of the adjective is replaced by 'i' before adding the suffix).

- hao - good
- hao**taa** - goodness
- vere - true, real
- veri**taa** - truth, reality

Nouns with this suffix acquire a certain own and additional meaning.

A noun that denotes a pure quality can be formed using the suffix -**nesa**
(in adjectives ending in -**ney**, -**ney** is replaced by -**nesa**).

- reale - real
- realitaa - reality as a new concept, an entity in itself
- reale**nesa** - reality as a quality or property
- gao - high
- gaotaa - height, the specific measurement of something
- gao**nesa** - greatness, nobility, the quality of being elevated or sublime

In some cases, by replacing the final **'e'** with an **'a'**, a noun can be
obtained with the meaning of "someone or something characterized by said
quality":

- adulte - adult
- adult**a** - adult person
- konstante - constant
- konstant**a** - constant

The already known suffix -**ka** forms a noun with the meaning of
"something/an object related to a quality/possessing a quality":

- mole - soft
- moli**ka** - pulp
- syao - small
- syao**ka** - trifle

### Translation exercise

- beauty
- length
- weight
- beauty (person)

## Methods of expressing definition

Most of the time, the definition of a noun is expressed with an adjective. But
this is not the only possibility. To make a definition from a noun, the
particle -**ney** is usually added to it, but in this way definitions are
mostly obtained that answer the question "whose?" or "related to":

| Lidepla            | English          |
|--------------------|------------------|
| kinda-ney kitaba   | child's book     |
| interes-ney kitaba | interesting book |

To establish a more general relationship, nouns can simply be placed one after
the other (and, if necessary, for clarity, joined with a hyphen):

| Lidepla     | English                                  |
|-------------|------------------------------------------|
| gina dey    | women's day, i.e. the holiday of March 8 |
| akwa-sporta | water sport, water sports                |

If the result of the combination of two concepts is something new, a new
concept for which a new word is needed, the components are written together:

| Lidepla     | English                                                  |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| kindakitaba | children's book, children's book; a special type of book |

There are a number of words that regularly participate in the formation of
these new words, for example:

- **jen** - person
- **yuan** - employee, worker
- **guan** - institution

| Lidepla        | English                                    |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| mar            | sea                                        |
| mar**jen**     | sailor; person related to the sea          |
| mar**yuan**    | sailor, cabin boy; person who works at sea |
| kitaba         | book                                       |
| kitaba**guan** | library                                    |

In addition, the definition can be expressed by a subordinate clause. If the
subordinate clause is before the defined word, it (the clause) is highlighted
with the special construction **ti** .. **na**:

| Lidepla                                       | English                                        |
|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Ti** yu vidi **na** kinda janmog dansi hao. | The child you see knows how to dance well.     |
| Yu vidi **ti** janmog dansi hao **na** kinda. | You see the child who knows how to dance well. |

If the subordinate clause is after the defined word (as in Russian), it is
introduced with the word **ke** – provided that the defined word is not part
of that subordinate clause. If after the construction the sentence continues,
it is better to separate the construction with the particle **na**, or to
formulate the word with the definition as the subject of the sentence:

| Lidepla                                       | English                                    |
|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Kinda **ke** yu vidi **na** janmog dansi hao. | The child you see knows how to dance well. |
| Kinda **ke** yu vidi, ta janmog dansi hao.    | The child you see knows how to dance well. |

The construction **to ke**:

| Lidepla                                                               | English                                                                        |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Me bu pri **to ke** yu shwo.                                          | I don't like what you say.                                                     |
| Me jan ke yu he zwo mucho. Bat me bu yao shwo om **to ke** yu he zwo. | I know you have done a lot. But I don't want to talk about what you have done. |

If the defined word is the subject of the subordinate clause, the word *kel*
is used:

| Lidepla                                 | English                                        |
|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Yu vidi kinda **kel** janmog dansi hao. | You see the child who knows how to dance well. |

Also **kel** is used with prepositions:

| Lidepla                              | English                           |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Es kinda om **kel** me he shwo a yu. | It is the child I told you about. |
| Es jen fo **kel** me jivi.           | It is the person I live for.      |

## Etiquette: talking about the weather

As is known, the most suitable topic for a trivial conversation is the weather
(**meteo**).

The expression "outside / on the street" (if the conversation takes place
indoors) is conveyed by the adverb **ausen** (outside).

About the temperature you can say with the adjectives:

- **lenge** - cold
- **warme** - warm
- **garme** - hot

| Lidepla                      | English                  |
|------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Es aika **lenge** **ausen**. | It's quite cold outside. |

In an informal conversation, a direct question with **"ob"** is not very
appropriate. You can ask in another way, using the word **ver** (from vere /
true) and get an answer:

| Lidepla                                  | English                                                              |
|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Es aika lenge ausen, bu **ver**?         | It's quite cold outside, isn't it?                                   |
| Ver, muy. / Non, bu es ver. Es ya warme. | Yes, it's true, very (cold). / No, it's not true. It's already warm. |

If you need to report some change, you can use the expression with **fa**-:

| Lidepla       | English              |
|---------------|----------------------|
| Zai fa-lenge. | It's getting colder. |

For precipitation there are special verbs: **pluvi** (for rain) and **snegi**
(for snow), as well as **fengi** (for wind):

| Lidepla              | English                          |
|----------------------|----------------------------------|
| Zai pluvi gro.       | It's raining a lot.              |
| Sembli ke sal snegi. | It looks like it will snow soon. |
| Sedey fengi idyen.   | It's a little windy today.       |

The same can be said using the nouns **pluva, snega, feng** and the verbs
**ye** (there is) and **yok** (there is not):

| Lidepla             | English               |
|---------------------|-----------------------|
| Sedey feng **yok**. | It's not windy today. |

Words needed to describe the state of the sky:

- **skay** - sky
- **klare** - clear
- **tume** - dark
- **surya** - sun
- **badal** - cloud

| Lidepla                                    | English                                                 |
|--------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Skay es **klare**, **badal** yok.          | The sky is clear, there are no clouds.                  |
| Ye mucho **tume badal**. Shayad sal pluvi. | There are many dark clouds. It will probably rain soon. |

On some excursion, the expressions **fa-dey**, **fa-nocha** will also not be
superfluous:

| Lidepla     | English                              |
|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Fa-dey**. | It's dawning / The day is beginning. |

Finally, you can simply comment:

| Lidepla               | English                        |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------|
| Meteo es hao, bu ver? | The weather is good, isn't it? |

And hear in response:

| Lidepla                               | English                                              |
|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Ver, yu es prave, meteo es ya ga hao. | Yes, you are right, the weather is really excellent. |

## Language in focus: Russian

Russian is the native language of about 150 million people. However, in terms
of its prevalence on the Internet, Russian is second only to English.

Specialists divide the history of the Russian language into several periods.
Proto-Slavic separated from Proto-Indo-European approximately in the 1st
century AD. By the 5th century, Proto-Slavic had split into several branches,
in particular Old Russian and Old Church Slavonic. People spoke Old Russian,
but at the same time, in the church, in books and documents, Old Church
Slavonic was used, and therefore the influence of the latter on Russian was
quite large. Thus, in modern Russian you can find pairs of words like "голова"
(golova - head, from Old Russian) and "глава" (glava - chapter, leader, from
Old Church Slavonic), where one word describes a common phenomenon, while the
other belongs to the realm of educated language.

The Tatar-Mongol invasion and the influence of the Tatar khanates led to the
borrowing of a certain number of Turkic words. By the 18th-19th centuries, Old
Church Slavonic was displaced from official use; however, at the same time,
borrowings and calques (that is, words constructed in the manner of foreign
ones) from Western European languages began to penetrate abundantly into
Russian speech, for example, from French, in which young nobles communicated
with each other, and from German, which at that time was the language of
science.

The Russian literary language was definitively formed at the beginning of the
19th century.

In the 20th century, the arrival of the Bolsheviks significantly influenced the
language (many new words appeared, a spelling reform was carried out). Nor can
one fail to mention the modern influence on Russian of the English-speaking
culture.

Fragment from "The Little Prince" (the transcription is presented here for
uniformity):

    О Маленький принц!
    oo 'malinki prints.

    Понемногу я понял также, как печальна и однообразна была твоя жизнь.
    panim'nogu ya 'ponil takz/she kak pi'chalna i adnaa'braz/sna be'la tva'ya z/shiz/sn.

    Долгое время у тебя было лишь одно развлечение: ты любовался закатом.
    'dolgae 'vremi/a u ti'bi/a 'byila lish ad'no raz/svli'chenie: tyi li/uba'valsi/a z/sa'katam.

    Я узнал об этом наутро четвертого дня, когда ты сказал:
    ya uz/s'nal ab 'etam na'utra chit'vi/ortava dni/a kag'da tyi ska'z/sal:

    Я очень люблю закат.
    ya 'ochin li/ub'li/u z/sa'kat
