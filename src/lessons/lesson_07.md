# Lingwa de Planeta | Pronoun and Adverb System

## Compound Pronoun and Adverb System

In the Lidepla language, there is a system of compound pronouns (i.e.,
words that can be used in place of other parts of speech).

Left part of the pronoun:

- **koy** - some, any
- **kada** - each
- **eni** - any
- **otre** - other
- **nul** - no, none
- **ol** - all

All these words by themselves can be used as adjectives.

Right part of the pronoun:

- **wan** - for people
- **sa** - abbreviation for kosa - thing
- **lok** - from loko - place
- **taim** - time
- **ves** - time (as in occurrence)
- **grad** - from grada - degree
- **komo** - how

For people:

- **koywan** - someone
- **kadawan** - everyone
- **eniwan** - anyone
- **nulwan** - no one, nobody
- **oli** - everyone, all

For objects:

- **koysa** - something
- **enisa** - anything
- **nixa** - nothing
- **olo** - everything

> (kada kosa - "each thing", is not abbreviated)

Sometimes it is necessary to talk about some characteristic or distinctive feature of a
person or thing. For this, the preposition **do** is used:

| Lidepla                          | English                       |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Me vidi koywan **do** longe har. | I see someone with long hair. |

For space:

- **koylok** - somewhere
- **kadalok** - everywhere
- **enilok** - anywhere
- **nullok** - nowhere

For time:

- **koytaim** - sometime
- **enitaim** - anytime
- **oltaim** - all the time
- **koyves** - sometimes
- **kadaves** - every time
- **sempre** - always
- **neva** - never

For degree:

- **koygrad** - to some extent
- **enigrad** - to any degree, as much as you want
- **nulgrad** - not at all

For manner:

- **koykomo** - somehow
- **enikomo** - in any way
- **nulkomo** - in no way

Yu mog kwesti eniwan, enilok. You can ask anyone, anywhere.

In a sentence, any negative word gives a negative nuance to the entire
sentence. If there are several negative words, the negative value is only reinforced.

| Lidepla                  | English                        |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Ta bu samaji nixa, neva! | He never understands anything! |

Also in Lidepla there are a number of compound adverbs:

- **enikas** - in any case
- **otrekas** - otherwise
- **olosam** - anyway, be that as it may
- **unves** - once, one occasion

Note: to talk about the reason, compound words are not used:

| Lidepla       | English                      |
|---------------|------------------------------|
| por koy kausa | for some reason, why         |
| por nul kausa | for no reason, "for nothing" |

### Translation Exercise

The preposition, as a rule, is placed before the word to which it
refers:

| Lidepla            | English                           |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Bli dom ye garden. | Near the house there is a garden. |

However, the word order can be changed if the particle **den** is placed before the word to which the preposition refers:

| Lidepla                | English                                  |
|------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Den dom bli ye garden. | With the house nearby there is a garden. |

With the same particle you can indicate a change in the position of the direct
object of the verb:

| Lidepla          | English    |
|------------------|------------|
| Me vidi ela.     | I see her. |
| Den ela me vidi. | Her I see. |

## Etiquette: how do you get to...?

If you find yourself in an unfamiliar place, you will probably need to ask
(for example, a friend who speaks Lidepla) how to get somewhere.

| Lidepla                       | English                             |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Komo me go a sentrale maidan? | How do I get to the central square? |

The answer you will probably get will be something like this:

| Lidepla                                                                        | English                                                                             |

| Raki bus til stopika “sentra”. Chu bus, krosi kamina, go a lefta.              | Take the bus to the "center" stop. Get off the bus, cross the street, go left.      |

## Language in focus: Japanese

Japanese is the native language of 125 million people. Scientists
debate the origin of the Japanese language. It is known for certain that
approximately in the 6th century BC, Japan established diplomatic relations
with China and Korea, thanks to which elements of the culture of these countries
penetrated the life of the Japanese. At this same time, the first written works appeared in
Japan, composed for the most part of Chinese characters. In the 16th century, the Portuguese introduced into Japan the achievements of
technological progress and the European religion, and, as a consequence, the Japanese
language was significantly enriched with loanwords from Portuguese. At
the beginning of the 17th century, the Japanese ruler imposed a ban on
Christianity and declared Japan a closed country. Since then, there have been
no significant external interventions in the development of the Japanese
language.

Excerpt from "The Little Prince":

    王子さま、あなたは、はればれしない日々を送ってこられたようだが、ぼくには、そのわけが、だんだんとわかってきました。
    oji-sama, anata wa, harebare shinai hibi o okutte korareta yoo da ga, boku ni wa, sono wake ga, dandan to wakatte kimashita.

    ながいこと、あなたの気が晴れるのは、しずかな入り日のころだけだったのですね。
    Nagai koto, anata no ki ga hareru no wa, shizuka na iribi no koro dake datta no desu ne.

    ぼくは四日めの朝、あなたが、ぼくにこういったとき、この、いままで知らずにいたことを知ったのです。
    Boku wa yokkame no asa, anata ga, boku ni koo itta toki, kono, ima made shirazu ni ita koto o shitta no desu.

    「ぼくね、日の暮れるころがだいすきなんだよ。」
    "Boku ne, hi no kureru koro ga daisuki nan'da yo."

There are few words taken from Japanese in Lidepla (however, the grammar of
this language was taken into account in the process of development of the grammar of
Lidepla):

- **arigatoo** - thank you (as an option)
- **fuki** - to blow
- **kiba** - fang
- **tana** - shelf
- **tawa** - tower
- **yuma** - humor
