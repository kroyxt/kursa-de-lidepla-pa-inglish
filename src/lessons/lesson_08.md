# Lingwa de Planeta | Verbal structures

If you have reached this lesson, it means that you have already mastered most
of the language's grammar and can start reading texts (with a dictionary or
by consulting the corresponding Spanish text), for example, fairy tales, in particular "Telephone Tales" by Gianni Rodari. Here, for
example, you have the story "Alice in Wonderland" with parallel text in Russian and Italian. A short and funny text read and understood
brings joy and inspires. However, it should be noted that, in order to get used to the
language and master the vocabulary, specialists advise reading long works.
If you decide to follow this advice, we recommend the translation of N. Chukovsky's fascinating
book "Sailor Rutherford in the Captivity of the New Zealanders". If you prefer fairy tales, the famous
"Little Prince" and the no less famous "Alice in Wonderland" await you (although
with Alice it is more difficult, since the fragments with wordplay,
obviously, are not literally translated). And finally, you can always start
communicating directly in Lidepla in the Facebook group or on the forum of the
"Lideplandia" website. We wish you success and hope to see you!

## Special verbs

The verbs **pai** (to get), **dai** (to give) and **lwo in** (to fall into) in
combination with other verbs acquire a new nuance of meaning:

| Lidepla                 | English                                                    |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Me **pai** ofni boxa.   | I managed to open the box. (achievement of a result)       |
| Ta **dai** kwiti molya. | He suddenly left his wife. (unexpected)                    |
| Ela **lwo in** plaki.   | She burst into tears. (depth of transition to a new state) |

In Lidepla there is a special verb that has no meaning of its own:
**fai**. It can be used with a noun, and then it acquires the meaning of
"to perform the usual action with this object":

| Lidepla        | English                      |
|----------------|------------------------------|
| **fai** kitaba | to read a book               |
| **fai** kama   | to sleep, to lie down in bed |

In general, the verb **fai** can be used instead of practically any
verb (predominantly in colloquial language, of course).

The verb **geti** means "to end up", "to get into some situation":

| Lidepla                     | English                           |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| geti inu mushkile situasion | to get into a difficult situation |

Sometimes the verb is repeated (with a hyphen). Such repetition gives a meaning of
short-duration and intense action, possibly repetitive:

| Lidepla                      | English                           |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Me yao **shwo-swho** kun yu. | I want to chat a little with you. |
| Ta **go-go** bli elay dom.   | He walked around near her house.  |

The repetition of the verb through the negative particle **bu**- is a (colloquial)
way to ask a question:

| Lidepla            | English               |
|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Yu lai-**bu**-lai? | Will you come or not? |

## Passive voice

To report that an action is performed on something/someone, the particle
**gei** is used:

| Lidepla            | English                            |
|--------------------|------------------------------------|
| Boxa **gei** ofni. | The box is opened / The box opens. |

To add who performs the action, the preposition **bay** is used:

| Lidepla                               | English                              |
|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Sey leta gei skribi **bay** may mata. | This letter is written by my mother. |

Sometimes it is important to say that someone performs an action
independently, without anyone's help. Or that the action is performed exactly by the
person being spoken of, by herself/himself. For this there is the word **selfa**
(self):

| Lidepla                                     | English                                                 |
|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Mata **selfa** he skribi se.                | The mother herself wrote this.                          |
| Sey shapa gwo gei porti bay rega **selfa**. | This hat was worn by the king himself.                  |
| Kinda he skribi se olo pa **selfa**.        | The child wrote all this alone (without anyone's help). |

If the action has already occurred and we are talking about the result, we can use the
known particle -**ney** and the verb **bi/es/bin**:

| Lidepla               | English           |
|-----------------------|-------------------|
| Dwar es ofni-**ney**. | The door is open. |

Often it is necessary to report the material something is made of. To
convey this meaning, the already known preposition **aus** is used:

| Lidepla                     | English                |
|-----------------------------|------------------------|
| Se es zwo-ney **aus** glas. | This is made of glass. |

### Translation Exercise

- In childhood (kinda-yash) I never managed to build (bildi) a sand (ramla) castle
(kastela), because usually my brother (brata) would come and break it (rupti).
- In reality (pa fakta) he didn't want to break it, he simply (simplem = sim) was
small and didn't understand what I was doing.
- And the castle was built many times by my hands (handas) and broken by
my brother's little foot (peda-ki).
- When the little brother saw that the castle was broken, he often began to
cry a lot, since he just (simply) wanted to play with me.

## Combination of actions

To report that two actions occurred simultaneously, the preposition **al** can be used,
which introduces circumstances:

| Lidepla              | English                                                                               |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Me lekti **al** chi. | I am eating and reading. / I am reading while eating. / I am reading during the meal. |

The same effect can be achieved by forming a gerund from one of the verbs with
the particle -**yen**:

| Lidepla               | English               |
|-----------------------|-----------------------|
| Me chi lekti-**yen**. | I am eating, reading. |

If an action becomes a certain background, approaching a quality, a participle can be formed with the particle -**she**:

| Lidepla                                  | English                                              |
|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Lubi-**she** jen yao sempre bi bli mutu. | Loving people always want to be close to each other. |

Or an adverb, with the particle -**shem**:

| Lidepla              | English                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Ta go ahfi-**shem**. | He goes stealthily ("in a hidden way"). |

It is also possible to form a noun with the particle -**sha**:

| Lidepla                    | English                            |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Gani-**sha** es may sista. | The person who sings is my sister. |

If an action occurred after another, the preposition **afte**
(after) is used:

| Lidepla                           | English                                                                  |
|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Afte chi me sempre promeni idyen. | After I eat, I always take a walk. / After eating, I always take a walk. |

Or an adverb, formed with the particle -**nem**:

| Lidepla               | English                                     |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Ta kan-te ofensi-nem. | She looked offended ("in an offended way"). |

### Translation Exercise

- Look, this girl is a truly loving mother (mata).
- She smiles (smaili) so sweetly (dulem) when she sees the child smile at her.
- She is always talking, telling something, walking (promeni) with him.
- And he doesn't cry when (after) he falls.
- He simply goes with his mom, who knows how to comfort (konsoli) so (well) that everything
bad is immediately forgotten.

## Language in focus: German

German is the native language of about 90 million people. The language
belongs to the Germanic branch of the Indo-European family. German as the language
of a unified Germanic people began to form at the beginning of the 11th century,
along with the unification of the multi-ethnic Germanic community, although it must
be recognized that many dialects are still spoken in Germany today,
and speakers of some of them sometimes barely understand each other. Later, at the same time that the economy developed, there was a
penetration into German speech of foreign words, in particular
French and Slavic. In the 20th century, a considerable amount of borrowings from English also appeared.

Excerpt from "The Little Prince" in German:

    Ach, kleiner Prinz, so nach und nach habe ich dein kleines schwermütiges Leben verstanden.
    ah 'klyainea prints s/zo nah unt nah 'habe ih dain 'klyaines shwea'mi/utiges leebn feash'tandn

    Das erfuhr ich am Morgen des vierten Tages, als du mir sagtest:
    das ea'fuua ih am moagn des 'fiiatn 'taages als du mia s/zaktest
    Ich liebe die Sonnenuntergänge sehr.
    ih 'liibedii 's/zonen'unteageenge s/zeea
