# Lingwa de Planeta | Word formation, derivation

The possibilities of word formation in Lidepla are affixes (various
prefixes and suffixes that are written together), particles (written with
a hyphen) and word compounding.

As a general rule, words and suffixes are combined directly in their basic
form, but in some cases the regular final vowel (i.e., 'a' in
nouns, 'e' in adjectives and 'i' in verbs) can be omitted.

## Affixes

Affixes, in addition to being divided into prefixes and suffixes (prefixes are added
at the beginning of the word, suffixes at the end), may or may not change the class
of the original word.

This chapter presents the complete system of Lidepla affixes. The most
commonly used ones have already been encountered in previous chapters.

## Particles

Particles are written with words with a hyphen. General particles, which can be
used with words of different classes, and special particles, which are used only
with words of a certain class, are distinguished.

### General

- Augmentative prefix particle **gro**- and diminutive-affective postfix particle -**ki**
(used with all parts of speech)

| Lidepla         | English                |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| **gro**-okos    | big eyes               |
| **gro**-gran    | enormous               |
| **gro**-jamilem | magnificently          |
| **gro**-chi     | to eat a lot, to gorge |

Note that in Lidepla there is also the adverb **gro**, so you can
say, for example, Zai **gro**-pluvi. or Zai pluvi **gro**.

| Lidepla           | English                 |
|-------------------|-------------------------|
| gela-**ki**       | little girl             |
| Zai pluvi-**ki**. | It's drizzling lightly. |

With proper nouns, it denotes a term of endearment: Ana-**ki**: Annie

- To express similarity ("like, kind of, a sort of") the postfix particle -**si** is used:

| Lidepla                 | English                                         |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Ela es may mata-**si**. | She is like my mother. She is my second mother. |
| rude-**si**             | reddish                                         |
| Ta studi-**si**.        | He/She sort of studies. ("Kind of studies.")    |

- To express partiality, the word **haf** (half) can be used, which can
function as a particle:

| Lidepla      | English        |
|--------------|----------------|
| **haf**-nadi | to partly hope |

Note that with nouns the word **haf** specifically means "half":
**haf**-dey: midday.

The particles **gro-, -ki, -si, haf-** do not change the class (function) of the
word.

- The particle **fa**- denotes an involuntary transition (i.e., occurring
independently of the will of the object) to a new state. The state word thus
formed can take some verbal particles:

| Lidepla                                     | English                                          |
|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Zai **fa**-dey.                             | It's dawning.                                    |
| Ela gwo **fa**-rude kada ves al shwo om lu. | She would blush every time she talked about him. |
| **fa**-astoni                               | to be surprised                                  |

- The particle **mah**- means a voluntary transition (i.e., requiring
conscious effort) of something (the object of the action) to a certain
state. The verb thus formed can take verbal particles:

| Lidepla                   | English             |
|---------------------------|---------------------|
| Me he **mah**-warme akwa. | I heated the water. |
| **mah**-chi               | to feed             |

- Note that **mah** can function independently as a causative verb.

| Lidepla                           | English           |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------|
| **Mah** akwa warme.               | Heat the water.   |
| **Mah** swa tayar. (=Tayari swa.) | Prepare yourself. |

- The determinative particle -**ney** is widely used to form
adjectives. The particle can be used with individual words as well as with
phrases:

| Lidepla               | English                       |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------|
| mata-**ney**          | maternal; mom's               |
| may-mata-**ney**      | my mom's, belonging to my mom |
| gran-oko-**ney** gela | big-eyed girl                 |
| turan-**ney**         | sudden                        |
| lekti-**ney**         | (pro)read                     |
| davem-lekti-**ney**   | read a long time ago          |
| lai-**ney**           | come                          |
| tri-**ney**           | third                         |

- To express a negative attitude, the general prefix particles
**fuy**- (expresses contempt, aversion) and **shma**- (expresses contempt) are used. These
particles are most often used with nouns, but it is also possible to use them
with other parts of speech:

| Lidepla         | English                                          |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **fuy**-jen     | unpleasant, disgusting person                    |
| **shma**-kaval  | nag, hack                                        |
| **shma**-skribi | to scribble (in the sense of writing carelessly) |

### Special

#### Noun particles

- The gender of a person or other living being can be specified with the
prefix particles **man**- and **gin**-:

| Lidepla       | English       |

|-----------------|----------------------------------|
| brata-**inloo** | non-blood brother (e.g., cousin) |

|-------------|-----------------|
| **en**-krai | to start crying |
| **ek**-krai | to cry out      |

- The determinative particle -**ke** forms adjectives from phrases with
verbs (with individual verbs it functions as a suffix and is written together):

| Lidepla                   | English                    |
|---------------------------|----------------------------|
| mucho-safari-**ke** gunsa | work related to travel     |
| treba-zwo-**ke** gunsa    | work that needs to be done |
| hao-yusi-**ke** sikin     | useful knife               |

|----------------|----------------|

From adjectives (participles) ending in -**she**, adverbs
(-**shem**) and nouns with the meaning of agent (-**sha**) can be formed:

For adjectives ending in -**ney**, formed from nouns ending in **Ca** (where C is a
consonant), the abbreviation type **Ca-ney** => **Ce** is allowed: far**ka-ney** => far**ke**

Resulting adjectives can participate in word formation:

- part**a-ney** => par**te** => partitaa (partiality)

Note that if -**ney** expresses genitive, the abbreviation is not made:

## Word compounding

Compound words in Lidepla can be formed by combining simple words. The meaning
of the resulting compound word depends primarily on the classes of the simple
words that compose it. Note that compound words are generally written together,
although, to improve readability, particularly long words can be written with a
hyphen.

### Compounding of full-meaning words

Any compound word consists of two parts: the main word and the
determiner, the main word always being the end of the compound word.
Most often, the meaning of a compound word can be explained with a phrase.
For example,

- **suryflor** (sunflower) = flor do surya
- **skribitabla** (desk) = tabla fo skribi.

However, it is important to understand that the meaning of a compound word
often differs slightly from the meaning of the phrase: a phrase characterizes
something concrete, for example, a specific object, while a compound word
defines a class of objects. That is, **tabla fo skribi** is a message that this
specific table is used for writing ("table on which one writes"), while
**skribitabla** designates a whole special class of tables used for writing
("desk").

#### Noun + noun

Meaning "special type":

- **spikabush** (hawthorn) (= bush do spika)
- **gubrajuk** (dung beetle) (= juk do gubra)
- **botelabrash** (bottle brush) (= brash fo botelas)
- **kindashamba** (children's room) (= shamba de kinda)
- **sabahfan** (breakfast) (= fan do sabah)
- **chaychiza** (teaspoon) (= chiza do chay)
- **kavaldom** (stable) (= dom do kaval)
- **legumgarden** (vegetable garden) (= garden do legum)
- **batalakraisa** (war cry) (= kraisa do batala = krai duran batala +
sa)
- **mauskapter** (mousetrap) (= kapter do maus = kapti maus + er)

In some cases, the meaning of the main word in the combination
differs slightly from its basic meaning:

- **kindagarden** (kindergarten) (= garden-si do kinda)

Meaning "part":

- **harriza** (hair roots) (= riza de har)
- **kaudanok** (tail tip) (= nok de kauda)
- **daokrosa** (crossroads) (= krosa de dao)

Combinations with other meanings, corresponding to phrases with the
preposition **de**, are generally considered precisely as combinations,
not as compound words, and are written with a hyphen:

- **surya-luma** (sunlight) (= luma de surya)
- **monta-kadena** (mountain range) (= kadena de monta)

Several words are used so frequently in combinations of the type
considered that their meaning approaches that of suffixes, so that the
combination denotes rather not a type of main word, but a word
derived from the determining word.

- **jen, man, gina** (person):
    - jadu**jen** (wizard/witch)
    - jadu**man** (wizard)
    - jadu**gina** (witch)
    - jadu (witchcraft)
    - arku**man** (archer, shooter (zodiac sign)) (= man do arku)
    - arku: (bow (weapon))

    - fish (fish)

+ **lok** (from loko) (place)
    + malina**lok**: raspberry bush (malina - raspberry) (= loko do (mucho) malina)

    - jen**menga** (crowd) (= menga de jen)
    - moska**menga** (swarm of flies)
    - moska (fly)

+ **guan** ("public establishment, institution")
    + fan**guan** (dining hall)
    + kitaba**guan** (library)

- **yuan** ("employee, worker, staff member, member of some
organization"; "worker of..., worker in...")
    - shop**yuan** (shop assistant)
    - polis**yuan** (policeman)
    - dwar**yuan** (doorman, concierge)
    - agni**yuan** (firefighter) (= agnibrigadayuan)
    - mar**yuan** (sailor)
    - tren**yuan** (conductor (on a train))

> marjen: person of the sea (life related to the sea), maryuan: sailor
> (work related to the sea), marnik (sea lover / marine life).

#### Verb + noun

Most often, combinations of the type "**verb + noun**"
define the type of concept/object expressed by the main word, and its
meaning can be represented as a phrase with the preposition **fo**:

- **saltikorda** (jump rope) (= korda fo salti)
- **lernikitaba** (textbook) (= kitaba fo lerni)
- **skribitabla** (desk) (= tabla fo skribi)
- **chifantabla** (dining table) (= tabla fo chifan)
- **guntaim** (working hours) (= taim fo gun)
- **frisiguan** (hairdresser) (= guan fo frisi)
- **habitilok** (place of residence, dwelling) (= lok(o) fo habiti)
- **banishamba** (bathroom) (= shamba fo bani)
- **banipen** (bathtub) (= pen fo bani)

The meaning may not be literal:

- fukiflor (dandelion)

Some combinations of the type **verb + noun** can be considered as
combinations of **participle + noun**:

- **flaifish** (flying fish) (= flai-she fish)
- **sendijen** (envoy) (= sendi-ney jen)

#### Adjective + noun

Combinations of the type "**adjective + noun**" name the type of
concept denoted by the main word:

- **laojen** (old man)
- **lao jen** (old person (concrete))
- **chyenlok** (shoal)
- **chyen lok(o)** (shallow place (any))

Adjectives ending in -**e** can omit the final vowel:

- **platbota** (barge (type of boat))
- **plate bota** (flat boat)
- **garibjen** (stranger, foreigner)
- **garibe jen** (strange person)

#### Noun + verb

The combination of a verb with its complement can be represented in the form of
a **noun + verb** combination, if it is necessary to emphasize the process as a
whole. Combinations of this type are quite rare, they are written with a
hyphen, for example:

## Language in focus: French

French belongs to the group of Romance languages, but precisely
French has moved furthest from Vulgar Latin. Before the Roman conquest, the
territory of present-day France was inhabited by the Gauls, tribes of the Celtic
group. Gaul was one of the Roman provinces for five centuries, from the
2nd-1st century BC, and during this time the local population gradually
assimilated with the Romans and adopted their language, retaining, however, in
speech the so-called "Celtic substratum", i.e., traces of the ancient
disappeared local language. After the fall of Rome in the 5th century AD, Gaul was
conquered by Germanic tribes, the Franks being the strongest. Of course, the
language of the conquerors influenced the language of the local population in some
way, but in the end Vulgar Latin prevailed, as a more developed dialect. And by
the 9th century, a new common language, French, was formed in northern France,
which by the 16th century became the main means of communication in the state.

Excerpt from The Little Prince in the original language: (in French, the stress
always falls on the last syllable)

    Ah! Petit prince, j’ai compris, peu à peu, ainsi ta petite vie mélancolique.
    aa pti prens je konpri pyo a pyo ensi ta ptit vi melankolik

    Tu n’avais eu longtemps pour distraction que la douceur des couchers de soleil.
    tyu nave e/o lontan pur distraksion kyo lya dusyor de kushe dyo soley

    J’ai appris ce détail nouveau, le quatrième jour au matin, quand tu m’as dit:
    je apri syo detay nuvo lyo katryem jur o maten kan tyu ma di

    J’aime bien les couchers de soleil.
    jem byen le kushe dyo soley
